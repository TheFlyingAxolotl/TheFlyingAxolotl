Still learning... but here are some things I spend more time on (in descending order):

- Game Development w Unity 🎮

Can video games be used to combat racism?
I don't know, but I sure see a lot of posts that say the only way to end racism is with Unity.

- Data Analysis w Python 📊

There are 2 kinds of data analysts:
1. Those who cane extrapolate from incomplete data

- VR app development + Voice recognition 

Ok more of because I have to do it as part of my research project 😅
